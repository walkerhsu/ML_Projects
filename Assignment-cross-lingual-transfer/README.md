# Assignment: Cross-lingual Transfer

## Prerequisites
- Navigate to the file `fairseq/fairseq/modules/layer_norm.py` and comment out lines 31 and 32.
- Run the script `experiment/req.sh`.

## Script Descriptions
- `experiment/test_translate_xnli.py`: Zero-shot translation from other languages to English.
  - TODO: Modify the script to perform k-shot translation with k > 0 to improve the translation quality. Examples for k-shot translation can be drawn from the dev set of XNLI since the other languagesâ€™ sentences are translations of the English ones. One can also use the dev set of the Flores-101 benchmark by MetaAI (https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/flores101/dataset/flores101_dataset.tar.gz).
- `experiment/test_xnli.py`: Zero-shot in-context learning on the English testing set of XNLI.
  - TODO: Modify the script to implement {0, 12}-shot in-context learning for part 1 and part 2.
